hi &Person 1& here :)---so obviously your &Object 1& is currently &Adjective 1&, I tried to &Action 1& your &Noun 1&s but apparently, they are incapable of &Action 2&ing. Anyways, you guys obviously have no idea what you're &Action 3&ing and literally cant &Action 4& anything. Im literally giving you my methods for &Action 5&ing, and could even help you find &Noun 2&. (trust me, you need it. Wait until someone &Action 6&s your &Object 1& for days, it can and probably will happen at some point). I just want an &Noun 3&'s discord tag so i can help you jesus chirtsttt
This is for you &Person 1&, &Person 2&, &Person 3&, and many many more. After the &Place 1& raids and &Action 1&s against me, I must take this into my own hands. Ya'll regret defying me Mark my words I will gain a &Noun 1& Then constructs my &Object 1& Then hire &Noun 2&s to &Action 2& &Noun 3&s with high level &Object 2& Then stockpile their &Object 3& Then we initiate the spawn &Action 2&ings. As soon as goes on the over world we &Action 2&. The &Noun 3& count of the &Noun 4& drops drastically as a resualt Old experienced &Noun 3&s quit We take their base's &Object 3&s To fortify our own. Before you even know it we will have taken control of the &Noun 4&. We will place &Noun 3& on &Object 4&s above water pit made of locked &Object 5&s. Then we push a button to release the &Object 4& place a block above their head And drown them Alternatively we make a mob pit for executions. We start &Action 3&ing &Noun 3&s &Object 3&s and trade. If you disobey the &Action 3&s, we hire &Noun 2&s to &Action 2& you. Then we start taking down &Noun 5&s. We make &Noun 2&s infiltrate your ranks, gain the &Noun 6&s. We strategically plan out &Action 4&, digging a network of tunnels under the &Noun 5&. Depending on the fortifications, we may make a &Mob 1& do the work for us. Then the only obstacle to world domination will be the &Noun 7&s. We will end them and their tyrannical rule swiftly. And enact our own &Noun 4& wide &Noun 8&s. And I will most a ceremony to crown me &Noun 9& permenantly. And build myself a &Building 1& that everyone must attend once every 10 in game days. I will make a &Noun 10&. I will make the disobedient &Noun 11&s &Noun 12&s to build me luxurious &Building 2&s and &Building 3&s. I will send the unworthy to the &Place 2&s. And the ones gaining too much &Object 6& to the drowning pits. For illeagle work like &Action 5&ing and &Action 6&ing, I will make my new &Noun 13& who are &Adjective 1& do it. I have it all set out. Join me, or suffer the consequences.
